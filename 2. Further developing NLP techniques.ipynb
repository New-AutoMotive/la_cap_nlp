      "olders and the public with transparency about the process. As one of our key principles is learning and evolving this plan, this review will feed into continuous review and revision of the delivery plans. This will enable us to be agile and expend e˙ort on the most e˙ective interventions. Next stepsIn 2020, and in parallel with the delivery planning, we need to develop a clear framework for monitoring and review in subsequent years. We will:  -Develop indicators for mitigation and resilience action covering both outputs (what is delivered through actions) and outcomes (the di˙erence made by the outputs). This monitoring will aim to identify and mitigate any unintended negative consequences.  -Establish a transparent process to monitor delivery, communicate progress and update planning. A note on o˝settingAchieving carbon neutrality will mean managing residual emissions remaining after all planned interventions have been made. This will typically involve o˙setting; this is a complex issue, with challenges around additionality, fairness, ˜nancing interventions and carbon accounting. For example, sequestration of carbon emissions through land use change may be more acceptable than sequestration through land use change outside the city. Given the need to prioritise direct interventions to reduce emissions, o˙setting will be considered as we get closer to 2030. However, given the potential lead in times to assemble ˜nance from across partners in the city, the potential need for land assembly and other complexities to resolve, we are proposing a review of o˙setting requirements in the late 2020 s. 69 DeliveryThis strategy sets out the city™s shared ambition and vision for a decade of transformative climate action. The route for delivering actions will be detailed in delivery plans, which will be developed and engaged on. We quickly need to move from strategy to action. Two key things will be required to enable this;  -Committed, collective, and collaborative leadership from across the city; and  -Resource and capacity to deliver. Committed, collective leadership from across the cityThe One City Approach has already proven successful in bringing partners together to provide collective leadership on key issues and challenges for the city. It is a mechanism aligned to sustainable development, where all actors in society need to play their part in order for us to succeed. Bristol is a city where leadership comes from all sectors and all people; formal structures will only ever represent a part of the picture. And of course people don™t need to wait for someone else in order to act. In fact, many people and businesses are already taking action individually and in communities or networks. This will need to continue and scale up. People™s individual actions to reduce their emissions and make their voices heard are extremely important, both in direct emissions reduction and in bringing about the policy changed we need to achieve these goals. However, governance provides accountability, support and co-ordination within wider networks. The One City Environmental Sustainability Board will continue to provide leadership and oversight of the delivery of the strategy, supported by all ˜ve other Boards, who all came together to support the development of this strategy. The Bristol Advisory Committee on Climate Change will continue to provide evidence and advice to city partners, as we move from action to delivery. Resource and capacity to deliverThe strategy will be followed by delivery plans, in some instances these will be existing statutory plans, in other instances a new approach will be required. In both cases, it is essential to ensure that there are su˛cient human and ˜nancial resources within partners to deliver the plans. This will require a commitment from an initial partner to kick-start and co-ordinate action. Delivery will comprise elements that are both top-down and bottom-up. People who live, work, play and invest in Bristol all have a crucial role to play. There is a strong existing ecosystem of partners working to deliver climate action across the city. It is essential that this work continues. However, in order to deliver at a new pace and scale of change, and to share learning e˙ectively and quickly, new programmes of work will be required. These may well be delivered by individual organisations, but co-ordination will be needed to achieve our shared ambitions as one of the UK™s leading cities. 70 Appendices 82. Introduction and approachGlobal warming and climate change present us with an urgent challenge we need to address. To solve this challenge there is the opportunity to take a collaborative city-wide approach to make transformational change. As the Environmental Sustainability Board we have developed this strategy with partners, based on robust evidence. Global warming has already impacted natural and human systems through increased ˝ooding, devastating wild˜res, storms, loss of biodiversity and extreme drought. Climate related risks to the environment, health, livelihoods, food security, raw materials, water supply and economic growth will rise, even if we manage to limit change to 1. 5 °C and will be felt di˙erently in di˙erent regions. Populations most at risk are marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable. In Bristol, some of our most deprived wards will be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including areas like Lawrence Hill, where ˝ood risk is also higher.  We urgently need to transform We are facing twin emergencies: a climate emergency and an ecological emergency. In addition to the climate emergency, we are also experiencing unprecedented global change due to land and sea use change, direct exploitation of species, pollution and invasive alien species. Human actions threaten more species with global extinction than ever before with the sixth mass extinction already underway. This strategy provides a way forward for Bristol to respond to the climate emergency. We explore opportunities to maximise bene˜ts to the ecological emergency, but a full response will be developed separately. This is a climate strategy for Bristol to respond to both: -Mitigation: the causes of climate change e. g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving carbon sinks; and  -Adaptation: addressing the potential impacts of climate change e. g. actions to adapt to ˝oods, storms or heatwaves and ongoing stresses such as sea level rise and increasing urban heat. It is essential that we address both climate mitigation and adaptation together as an integrated response as no single option is su˛cient by itself. Integrated consideration of adaptation and mitigation will allow us to identify interdependencies, be more e˛cient and minimise risk. The world is rapidly changing and there is uncertainty over what the future will look like. Climate change is likely to impact the city directly though local extreme weather events and through changes further a˜eld which may impact the city indirectly by impacting the economy and the supply of goods and services, such as food or public services. We need to plan for, adapt and build our resilience for projected future risk in a way that provides wider co-bene˜ts so that, no matter what the future looks like, our city will be better for our citizens. This plan is for 2030 when we aim to have the plans and mitigation in place or in progress to make us resilient for events that will occur in 2030 and well beyond. We are facing a climate and ecological emergencyHuman activities are estimated to have caused 1 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. We are already seeing devastating impacts of 1 °C warming; this is expected to get worse. The science on the climate emergency is clear; we need urgent action to reduce our carbon emissions to limit global temperature rise to below 1. 5 oC, and so prevent disastrous impacts. We also need to prepare for a changing climate. 71 Glossary and de˚nitionsDe˚nitionsThe following key terms are used within this strategy: Climate change mitigation: A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2012 ). Carbon emissions: Throughout this strategy, we have used the term carbon emissions as a shorthand for all greenhouse gas emissions, expressed as CO 2 e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This strategy refers to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, covering scopes 1 - 3, in line with the GHG protocol for cities:  -Scope 1 emissions Direct emissions from owned or controlled services, e. g. fuel combustion, vehicle use.  -Scope 2 emissions Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, e. g. electricity, electric heating.  -Scope 3 emissions All other indirect emissions after scope 2 have been accounted that occur in the entity™s footprint, e. g. production of goods and services, waste disposal, etc. Carbon neutral: Where the carbon emissions caused by an entity (e. g. individual, business, product, etc.) have either been eliminated, or balanced by removals of greenhouse gasses (including o˙setting). This can sometimes be referred to as net zero. For the purposes of this strategy, we have used ﬁcarbon neutralﬂ as shorthand for greenhouse gas emission neutrality. Carbon o˝setting: The action or process of compensating for carbon dioxide emissions arising from industrial or other human activity, by participating in schemes designed to make equivalent reductions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This o˙setting can either be local or international. Carbon sequestration: The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it˚in a carbon sink, a ˜xed molecule in soil, oceans or plants.˚Climate change adaptation: The process of adapting, either through reducing the impact of the climate hazard, or through reducing exposure or vulnerability, to the actual or expected climate and its e˙ects. Climate resilient: Ability of human and non-human systems to withstand and respond to future changes in the earth™s climate, e. g. extreme weather temperatures, ˝ooding, increased rainfall, etc. Climate resilient by 2030 : In this strategy, we have used this term to mean being prepared, through adaptive planning, for a global temperature rise of up to 4. 3 OC by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. Physical climate risk: comprises an assessment of climate hazard exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Climate hazard: climate-related physical events, such as ˝ooding or drought. Sensitivity: the vulnerability of assets to be impacted by climate hazards based on their condition and capacity and the potential consequences of these hazards on people. 72 Glossary and de˚nitionsAdaptive capacity: the ability of systems, organisations or people to adjust to events, respond to consequences or take advantage of opportunities. Health and wellbeing impacts of climate change: Health impacts, in the context of the strategy, are linked to more physical metrics such as increased risk of illness from increased temperatures (e. g. heat stroke). Wellbeing impacts consider a wider range of aspects, such as physical, economic, social, emotional and psychological wellbeing. In both cases, impacts could be positive or negative depending on the driver, e. g. poorly insulated dwellings can have a negative impact on health through increased risk of mould and damp conditions, whereas well insulated dwellings, that are also optimally designed to avoid overheating in summer, can have a positive wellbeing impact through reduced energy costs and feeling of comfort. Natural capital: Natural capital refers to the biological, physical and chemical resources/assets, known as ‚Stock™. According to agreed convention, this Stock broadly includes biodiversity (ecological communities), soils, freshwater, land, minerals, atmosphere (air), subsoil assets, and oceans. Biodiversity: The variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.  Blue green infrastructure: A strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services is both rural and urban settings. Ecosystem services: Processes and functions provided by the earth™s natural resources, e. g. pollination, ˝ood mitigation, air puri˜cation. 73 References -Arup, 2020 a, Climate Resilience Assessment for Bristol -Arup 2020 b, Bristol™s businesses scope 3 emissions.  -Bristol City Council, BCC, 2018, City Leap Prospectus [https://www. energyservicebristol. co. uk/wp-content/pdf/City_Leap_Prospectus% 204 - 5 - 18. pdf] -BGCP, 2015 : Bristol Green Capital Partnership, European Green Capital Award 2015 [https://bristolgreencapital. org/who-we-are/european-green-capital-award/]  -C 40, 2018 : C 40 Cities, Climate Action Planning Framework, 15. 05. 2018 [https://cdn. locomotive. works/sites/ 5 ab 410 c 8 a 2 f 4220 f 797 e/pages/ 5 ae 2 f 9237 c 4837 e 195 d 0 e 00 /˜les/CAP_Framework_ 2018. pdf? 1541 ]  -Cebellos et al, 2017 : Ceballos, G., Ehrlich, P.

Introduction and approachTaking this integrated approach will enable our climate action to support Bristol™s wider goal, set out in the One City Plan, of becoming a fair, healthy and sustainable city. A city of hope and aspiration, where everyone can share in its success. An integrated approach to delivering our One City Climate Strategy will enable us to achieve so much more for Bristol than simply achieving carbon neutrality and climate resilience. Working together as a city, we can achieve a future that delivers improvements in public health, reduced costs for public services, improved air quality, reduced congestion, reduced inequalities and reduced poverty, increases in job and economic opportunities across society, greater community engagement, improved biodiversity alongside wider environmental bene˜ts such as soil and water quality, and more. This will require us, as the Environmental Sustainability Board, to work closely with the Housing Board, the Health and Wellbeing Board, the Learning and Skills Board, the Economy Board and the Transport Board, as well as with a wide range of others across the city. We are committed to doing this, as we recognise the opportunity that tackling the climate emergency brings to tackle many more challenges in the city. It will also require others to step up and take action across the city. 102. Introduction and approachBristol™s Advisory Committee on Climate ChangeEnvironmental Sustainability BoardOne City Boards and One City ApproachUnderpinned by evidence and engagementClimate strategyClimate actionDelivery plansIn placeIn progressStill to be developedDeveloping this strategyBristol™s˚One City Approach brings together a wide range of public, private, and third sector partners within Bristol. As part of this approach, six boards have been set up to provide leadership on key themes. As the Environmental Sustainability Board, we have led the development of this strategy, engaging with all of the other ˜ve boards, recognising the cross-cutting nature of the challenge we face. All of the underpinning evidence to inform this strategy has been developed with advice and challenge from the Bristol Advisory Committee on Climate Change. This evidence is explained in more detail in the remainder of this section. We recognise that evidence is not ˜xed. As this evidence base evolves and we gain new learning, we will use this knowledge to overcome challenges and respond to new opportunities that arise as we implement this strategy together. We will continue to have an open dialogue and engage with individuals, households, organisations and businesses over the coming decade. This strategy sets the direction of travel for Bristol as a city. A number of detailed delivery plans will be developed and work has already started on these. As we explore in section 3, we are not starting from scratch, there is wealth of activity in the city that is already underway to support the journey towards our vision. Businesses, organisations, communities and individuals will need to work hand in hand to deliver a step change in terms of scale and pace of action.    We have engaged with over 300 people in the development of this strategy. \n"
